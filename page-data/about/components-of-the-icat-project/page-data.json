If you simply want to install components then go to\n<a href=\"/installation/\" title=\"Installation\">Installation</a>. To\nget an overview of what is happening across the repositories take a look\nat <a href=\"https://waffle.io/icatproject/icat.server\">waffle.io</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"/about/ICAT-Components.png\" alt=\"ICAT Components\" title=\"ICAT Components\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>ICAT server and client : the metadata catalogue provides  a SOAP web\nservice interface to the underlying database with an easy to use\nAPI. Authentication makes use of plugins and authorization is rule\nbased. The icat-setup tool is provided for initial configuration of\nan ICAT for a facility and a simple editor, ice, is also available.\nThough ice is convenient as a web interface the\n<a href=\"http://ftp.esrf.fr/pub/bliss/icatmanager/%20\">IcatManager</a>, which\nis a stand-alone application, provides similar functionality but is\nmuch more pleasant to use.</li>\n<li>IDS: the ICAT Data Service provides a uniform interface to data\ncatalogued by ICAT. It exposes a RESTful web service and provides\nthe ability to upload individual files and to download one or more\nfiles. When a file is uploaded the metadata are stored in ICAT. ICAT\nauthorization rules for the \"Datafile\" ICAT are applied to control\nread/write access to the files in the IDS. If multiple files are\nrequested they are packaged in zip format. The interface has some\ncalls which assume two level storage (with all data available on a\npossibly slow system and recently used data on another) however it\nwill work fine with only one level. The server makes use of a plugin\nmechanism so that a facility can choose its own directory structure\nfor file storage. A two level file storage example plugin is\nprovided as is an interface to which a plugin must conform if you\nchoose to write your own.</li>\n<li>TopCAT: a web-based GUI able to search across multiple ICAT\ninstances, to download data and soon it will be able to upload data\nas well. It makes use of both ICAT core and the IDS.</li>\n<li>IJP: the ICAT Job Portal to allow submission of jobs where data\nselection is based on ICAT information.  Both batch and interactive\njobs are supported. It makes use of both ICAT core and the IDS. It\nis not currently shown on the diagram above.</li>\n<li>To see the structure of ICAT you can use the <a href=\"/user-documentation/icat-manager/\">ICAT\nManager</a>.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Components of the ICAT Project","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/about/components-of-the-icat-project/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2070941184","262013593","3248290905","3649515864","4090520584"]}
